# CallousKitchen
This is my capstone project from my final year at Sheridan College. 

Team members: Peter Szadurksi, Kevin Gadelha, Vladyslav Hrusha.

Description:
This is a kitchen inventory and recipe suggestion app that helps users keep themselves organized while reducing food waste. The backend is a C# web service and there are two front ends: a web app and an Android app.

My responsibilities:
I mainly worked on the Android application and I specifically focused on the UI.
